The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
first ten natural numbers and
the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference
between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
numbers and the square of the sum.

    Not copied. how the hell did I manage an optimization like this??

    Takes advantage of the fact that y^2 = y+x+x^2 where y > 4
    I.e

    4 * 4 = 16
    5 * 5 = 25  ==  4 + 5 + 16

    Hard code the first few squares which dont share this behaviour
