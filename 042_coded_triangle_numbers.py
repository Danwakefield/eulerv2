The n^th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,
    t_n = Â½n(n+1)
so the first ten triangle numbers are:
    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
By converting each letter in a word to a
number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these
values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19
+ 11 + 25 = 55 = t_10 . If the word value is a triangle number then
we shall call the word a triangle word. Using words.txt (right click
and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-
thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?

Answer: 162
